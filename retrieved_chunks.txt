think it would. Justice Gorsuch, of course, here again, adequacy is conceded. So the court doesn't really have to get into that. But you alluded to this yourself. I mean, the FCC operates in a highly reg. You know, this is a highly regulated industry. You have an amicus brief from some of the major trade associations who are repeat players. They have armies of people who follow what goes on at the fcc. They engage in litigation. Those folks are unlikely to be able to make any kind of adequacy

true and if so, to what extent? Okay, we've considered it. It's, that's an important factor. It is no substantive. Why isn't that an arbitrary and capricious challenge though? I mean, it seems to me that if you are complaining about the FCC and the way in which they have exercised its authority, you should be bringing that kind of case. That's not a non delegation problem. I don't think it has to be one or the other though, your honor, I think, well, there has to be a distinction between the

significant because the only opportunity that a party in the plaintiff's shoes in this case would have, should they had they wanted to try to challenge that interpretation, would be to do what another party did, which is to file a petition for reconsideration in front of the agency. That is an empty promise of judicial review. As Justice Gorsk, as Justice Kavanaugh, you pointed out in your concurrence and PDR network, because that petition for reconsideration of the FCC's Amerifactors order has

for 30 years. You just look at the text. The text. It leaps out at you. Substantial majority of residential customers essential to education, public health and public safety, available at reasonable and affordable rates. Again, those are things the FCC only must consider the extent to which they don't even have to consider whether those are actually true. They have to say do we think that this is true and if so, to what extent? Okay, we've considered it. It's, that's an important factor. It is

And would you feel differently if the principles were worded, that quality services be available at just reasonable and affordable rates? That's one of the problems, is that it says should. But I think more fundamentally the problem is, as the FCC itself has said for 30 years now almost that. Anyone? Okay, but put aside, this is a legal question. This is a statutory interpretation question. So the FCC can say that all at once, but we still have to interpret the statute. Right. So we're not

It's not even saying consider it. If the FCC walked into this court and said we can do something that like a tiny minority of residential customers have, I think that they would lose that case. I mean, there are constraints on this agency and on their operation of the program. And if we're going to read the statute just, I mean, honestly, I think that that's a not credible reading of this statute. This statute clearly puts constraints on. These are the services that all the rest of us take for
