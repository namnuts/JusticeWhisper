for 30 years. You just look at the text. The text. It leaps out at you. Substantial majority of residential customers essential to education, public health and public safety, available at reasonable and affordable rates. Again, those are things the FCC only must consider the extent to which they don't even have to consider whether those are actually true. They have to say do we think that this is true and if so, to what extent? Okay, we've considered it. It's, that's an important factor. It is

majority of residential customers already have that are essential to living in our world, that are essential to education, public health and public safety. And those things have to be available at affordable rates. So the FCC can't do anything by way of this program that is not basically geared towards getting those who live in very rural areas or who are very low income to getting those access, getting those people access to services that all the rest of us have.

I think they're doing this more specifically than many of the appropriations mechanisms that we reviewed recently. I think one of my colleagues wrote about this, in which we have appropriations to agencies with no more guidance than says it's a continuing X
